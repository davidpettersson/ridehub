# Frontend and Styling Guidelines

## CSS Framework Migration
- The current styling is based on Tailwind CSS
- New HTML and CSS should be based on Bootstrap and regular CSS classes
- All CSS should be in a global CSS file called styling.css
- As views are modified, carefully craft new Bootstrap-compatible code
- Try to let Tailwind and Bootstrap co-exist during migration

## Mobile-First Design
- Users will default to using a mobile device when accessing the web pages
- Make all pages responsive
- Consider mobile users as the primary audience when designing interfaces

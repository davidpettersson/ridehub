# Testing Guidelines

## Test Structure
- Use the arrange-act-assert pattern for all tests
- Structure tests with clear sections:
  - **Arrange**: Set up test data and conditions
  - **Act**: Execute the functionality being tested
  - **Assert**: Verify the expected outcomes

## Test Organization
- Follow consistent naming conventions for test methods
- Group related tests in appropriate test classes
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order

# Data Validation Guidelines

## Model Validation Requirements
- Always create validations for models to ensure the integrity of the application
- If it is not clear which validation to add, ask the user for clarification
- Implement proper data validation at the model level to prevent invalid data entry
- Consider both field-level and model-level validation constraints

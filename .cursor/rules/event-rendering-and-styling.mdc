# Event styling

## General event structure

 - Each event is normally rendered in its own card

## Event headers

 - Event headers consist of two lines: the event name line, and the event key details line.
 - Event name lines should just have the event name in them unless there are any special conditions
 - Event key details consists of the date+time, plus an optional location.
 - Date and time should be rendered like this: "<calendar icon> Monday, May 5, 2025 <clock icon> 5:00 pm"
 - Location should be rendered using a map icon. If a location URL exists, make the location text a hyperlink. Make sure there is affordability so the user understands it can be clicked

## Cancelled events

 - Cancelled events should always have a strikethrough of the event name and be suffixed by "(cancelled)""
 - When possible colors should be subdued
